## NVIDIA - A GPU deep learning workshop

university HPC: K20 GPU
containers: singularity <-- docker


### Project 1: Getting Started with Deep Learning (Caffe, DIGITS)  
- Caffe: fast, new algorithms, python interface, data pre-proessing and management  
    + protobuf model format  
    + define network architecture and training parameters, no coding required  
    + get real-time feedback  
- DIGITS built on Caffe: https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS  
    + python & web based  
- machine learning > neural network > deep learning  
- aritificial neural network: given sufficient training data an artificial neural network can approximate very complex functions mapping raw data to outpu decisions  
- benefits 
    + features are automatically learned  
    + robustness to natural variations in the data  
    + generalizable: the same neural net approach can be used for many different applications and data types  
    + scalable: performance improves with more data, method is massively parallelizable  
- convolution: center element of the kernel is placed over the source pixel
