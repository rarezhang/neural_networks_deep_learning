    "- We can use an RNN to regress a value based on sequential inputs - this is what we did in our binary addition example.\n",
    "- We can use an RNN to classify it's input - an NLP example of this approach is determining the positive or negative sentiment of tweets.  \n",
    "- We can also use RNNs to forecast future values of sequences given their historical values - an NLP example of this approach is forecasting the next word in a partial sentence.  This can be very useful in real-time text translation between languages.\n",

In that post Andrej showed how an RNN can be trained on a text corpus, one character at a time, to predict the next character in the sequence.  Once trained in this way the network can be provided a seed of characters to begin a sequence and then asked to recursively predict as many additional characters in the sequence as we like.  If training has been successful the generated characters will form words, sentences and even paragraphs with the appropriate vocabulary, grammar and structure learned from the training corpus."

    "## Challenges in training RNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately simple RNNs with many stacked layers can be brittle and difficult to train.  This brittleness arises because the backpropagation of gradients within a neural network is a recursive multiplication process.  This means that if the gradients are small they will shrink exponentially and if they are large they will grow exponentially.  These problems are called \"vanishing\" and \"exploding\" gradients respectively.  One way to look at this unrolling is that it creates a very deep feed-forward neural network, especially for deep RNNs applied to long time sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Backprop in RNNs](files/backpropRNN.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you see in the diagram the red arrows representing the backpropagation of gradients accumulate in very long chains for an RNN on the right versus the feed-forward network on the left and so can easily vanish or explode through multiplication.  For a much more detailed explanation of these problems, see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp4oKq4kCYs) video by Geoffrey Hinton.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular solutions for preventing vanishing and exploding gradients is a modified network structure called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).  For a thorough understanding of LSTM networks, after completing this lab, I recommend you read [this](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs) blog post.  LSTMs were introduced by [Hochreiter & Schmidhuber](http://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/pdfs/Hochreiter97_lstm.pdf) in 1997 and have been subsequently refined and put to good use by many people.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now the key idea to remember about LSTM layers is that they add gating functions that can control how much the next network state is determined by new input and how much it is determined by what has already been seen. By allowing the network to learn how to control these gates, vanishing and exploding gradients can be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTM layers can be viewed as a drop-in replacement for the vanilla RNN layer we have already defined.  In `torch-rnn` we can choose to make this replacement by setting the variable `opt.model_type` to 'lstm'.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 3:**  Modify in the code above to set `opt.model_type = 'lstm'` and re-run the training.  What happens to model accuracy and training speed?  \n",

    "**Answer 1:** You will find that a longer training sequence length, more RNN layers or a larger RNN will all improve the quality of the generated text but will also increase training time for the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer 2:** You will find that training time is about 1.5X slower.  This is because cuDNN v5 introduced a number of optimizations for RNN layers, for example fusing of multiple stacked layers into a smaller number of more efficient operations.  You can read more about these optimizations in [this blog post](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/optimizing-recurrent-neural-networks-cudnn-5/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer 3:** You will find that training time takes a little longer due to the added complexity of an LSTM layer versus an RNN layer.  You may also assess that the quality of the generated text is worse. This is due to the LSTM overfitting the training data. \n",
