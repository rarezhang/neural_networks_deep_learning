"""
AvgPool2D: How to Incorporate Average pooling into a PyTorch Neural Network
"""

"""
It is common practice to use either max pooling or average pooling at the end of a neural network but before the output layer in order to reduce the features to a smaller, summarized form.


Max pooling strips away all information of the specified kernel except for the strongest signal.


Average pooling summarizes the signal in the kernel to a single average.
