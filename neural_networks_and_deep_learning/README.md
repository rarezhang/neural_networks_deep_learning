# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

[Reading notes](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)

### neural nets
- neural networks: __infer rules__  
- neural networks:  
    + two types of artificial neuron:  
        * perceptron  
        * sigmoid neuron  
    + standard learning algorithms: stochastic gradient descent  


### perceptrons  
- take binary inputs and produces a single binary output

### sigmoid neuron
